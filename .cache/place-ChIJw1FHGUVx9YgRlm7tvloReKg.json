From start to finish, the attentiveness, quality of service, and depth of knowledge around carpet and design were outstanding.\nWe worked with Jeremy on the sales side, and he was an absolute pleasure—knowledgeable, patient, and genuinely invested in helping us find the right solution. He made the entire process feel easy and thoughtful.\nThe installation team was equally impressive. They were mindful, diligent, and incredibly respectful of our home and work space, which we truly appreciated.\nWe had a stair runner installed, and the end result is beautiful—expertly done and exactly what we envisioned. We would highly recommend Woodstock Carpet Depot to anyone looking for quality product, skilled craftsmanship, and exceptional customer service.","time":1766940201,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Susan Shepard","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106434553348805383222/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLAyML5NV33rOUKP6wW_r4ubgDYKAqGq-oUDs0gKwFKRtcO_g=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Carpet Depot is awesome and the people are great!

Our first interaction was with Jeremy Eaves and he was phenomenal.  Helped us find our perfect LVP flooring and carpet in a matter of minutes.  Matt was able to come out in a few days to get all of our rooms measured and we were put on the schedule to be installed that same week.  Juan and his team were superb in getting all of the old flooring up and new down in just 2 days.  We are very happy with the quality of product from Carpet Depot and the level of service received from Jeremy, Matt and Juan.  Fair pricing, quick service and friendly staff.  Definitely give them a call for your next flooring project.  THANK YOU!!!","time":1690293908,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Robert Mangum","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108988430061379364028/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUIXs2RuL93Nkl2rlJMbYh5Mp4J5vcUxXvuqLO0SHwjIsXg2FTMBw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"11 months ago","text":"Jeremy did a phenomenal job and was so patient with our selecting an LVP color/style!
