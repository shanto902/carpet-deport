Kevin came out promptly, measured the spaces, and brought a selection of samples. He was thorough in answering all my questions. Although the exact carpet I was looking for wasn’t in his samples, he invited me to visit their store to explore more options.\n\nI visited the store on March 20th and worked with Leslie, who was incredibly knowledgeable and polite. She helped me find a carpet I absolutely fell in love with. I didn’t make a decision right away because I was planning to get another quote from a different company the next day.\n\nWhat ultimately convinced me to go with Carpet Depot was Kevin’s insight about the need to shave my doors, given the higher grade of carpet and padding I chose. The competitive and reasonable price sealed the deal.\n\nThe installation was scheduled for March 29th, and Leslie arranged for their best installer, Jose, to handle the job. My concern was that the furniture in the three rooms was heavy and solid, and Jose arrived alone. However, after showing him the rooms, he reassured me that he could manage on his own. I was genuinely impressed with how carefully and efficiently he moved the furniture. The installation went smoothly, and the results exceeded my expectations.\n\nThank you, Carpet Depot!","time":1743448797,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Josh May","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115733018595897306850/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLsJRRHeZppmr2gqt4zVpsojwMym9E4S8w5Jh7g4GHYI5zx2Q=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"The owner was very helpful in the process of deciding what type of floor we wanted in our basement. When we decided and was given the price, I was pleasantly surprised. Very reasonable price. When the guys came to install the floor, they were in and out within a few hours.

Because we had such a fantastic experience with them, we decided to go back to them.\n\nAfter pricing Luxury Vinyl Plank flooring at a couple other retailers, including the big-box DIY stores, we stopped back by Carpet Depot to speak with Kevin (the owner) and his staff.  As before, they were knowledgeable and professional in every way.  After taking a few weeks to decide regarding the type of LVP (more for my wife than me), we made our decision and set up a time for Kevin to come by to double check our measurements.\n\nThe price was extremely good and very competitive.  As with most things in today’s retail market, it took a few weeks for the materials to come in: we put LVP on the downstairs floor and a high-grade commercial carpet on the stairs.  During the whole “waiting” period, either Kevin or his staff called us to keep us informed where everything was or wasn’t.\n\nWhen everything came in, we were told it could take up to two days.  We had to have an area of tongue-and-groove ¾ inch oak removed and the old carpeting in the fireplace room and the stairs removed as well, so we figured this was reasonable.  When the installation crew arrived, they informed us it would all be done in one day!\n\nThe installation guys were phenomenal.  Face it, it doesn’t matter how nice the flooring is unless it is installed properly.  The crew was polite, and they worked extremely hard.  I used to manage job sites and these guys were great!  This was perhaps the number one of the reason why we returned to Carpet Depot—the professionalism and service of Kevin’s installation crews.\n\nWe are beyond satisfied with our new floors!  They finished quickly, they were extremely concerned with our satisfaction, and they were professional.  The market right now is very tight cost-wise.  You always get what you pay for and there is little ability for a quality install and product at a very low price.  This is just where we are in our economy today.\n\nWhat makes the difference is the customer service and the people doing the service.  The biggest difference in today’s economy is the service.  Carpet Depot delivers on this.  And I have longer than ten years’ experience to prove it!","time":1657311410,"translated":false}],"opening_hours":{"periods":[{"close":{"day":1,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":1,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":2,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":2,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":3,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":3,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":4,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":4,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":5,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":5,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":6,"time":"1500"},"open":{"day":6,"time":"0930"}}],"weekday_text":["Monday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM","Tuesday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM","Wednesday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM","Thursday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM","Friday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM","Saturday: 9:30 AM – 3:00 PM","Sunday: Closed"]}},"timestamp":1768649868486}
