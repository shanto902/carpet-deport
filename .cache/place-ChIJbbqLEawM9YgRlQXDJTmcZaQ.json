David on the sales team was very knowledgeable and was able to guide us to just the right floor product type and pattern. They measured our room and had all the flooring within a day or two. Scheduling the install was easy, Daniel the installer showed up at the time promised and called when he was on the way. He did a great job installing the LVP and also had to customize a landing with steps. Everything looks great and we are so very pleased and are enjoying our basement once again. Highly recommend Carpet Depot.","time":1739676140,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Paul Hatcher","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116843576679744925988/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUgPj1fid1CcmgKMhMpvhL3Ci53BjJS_DF1-fsTNj8uS9_26sBX=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 years ago","text":"Posting this review for my wife as she handled most of this project but I agree! Great experience working with this group!  Kerrie was great to work with and the teams used for carpet and vinyl plank flooring were prompt and friendly too!  We have already recommended CD to a friend!  The quality work shows! Love how the natural light shows the variation in the floors.","time":1584813517,"translated":false},{"author_name":"J Perejil","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114084087796581328954/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX6dob9mZXsNindq6JyB1mXTRI6geRwxasCQTI2peUNx40ZBc8_=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"8 months ago","text":"I highly recommend Carpet Depot!  David, Chico, and the team at Carpet Depot took great care of us.  They have a wide selection.  They knocked it out of the park on install day.  The install team are very courteous and professional. They took care of our big stuff, ripped everything out, put in the new pads and carpet, put everything back in place. They were in and out one day with a lot of work.","time":1730122446,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Paige Doerr","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103787218799902715718/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK0y-j-wX8GWSrM1G4s-kq3I7E849CGqpgHuMSbfVaX49gByg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"I highly recommend Carpet Depot in downtown Roswell.
