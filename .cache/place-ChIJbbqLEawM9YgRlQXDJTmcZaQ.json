From the moment we walked in, Sarah made us feel so welcome, was extremely knowledgeable, and made the otherwise daunting and overwhelming experience of trying to choose new carpets FUN!\n\nShe has such a great energy about her and seems extremely hard working and like a person that gets things moving and done, which we really appreciated.  She made time to come measure right away at our convenience before she had to go to another appointment, and we had an estimate and follow up call very shortly.\n\nWe were so impressed with Sarah’s customer service that I felt compelled to write a review and send some well deserved kudos her way.  Loved how she seemed to just know her stuff and do everything with such grace and ease!","time":1753703934,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Gail Tate","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100200746231174631664/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVmtXNAJEslXOVr4iLJjDiTMOklQ7BwsaJ9DysQwnj3tDLFLSCY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"We enjoyed our experience with Carpet Depot from start to finish. David on the sales team was very knowledgeable and was able to guide us to just the right floor product type and pattern. They measured our room and had all the flooring within a day or two. Scheduling the install was easy, Daniel the installer showed up at the time promised and called when he was on the way. He did a great job installing the LVP and also had to customize a landing with steps. Everything looks great and we are so very pleased and are enjoying our basement once again. Highly recommend Carpet Depot.","time":1739676140,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Stephanie Repp","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110965716420253721804/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUZGLerD2M3QsdOirkcP06f7sHcTGovkJQzKcFdxypQZf_arsdJ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"David was very easy to work with and helped me pick the right carpet for our room.

Great experience working with this group!  Kerrie was great to work with and the teams used for carpet and vinyl plank flooring were prompt and friendly too!  We have already recommended CD to a friend!  The quality work shows! Love how the natural light shows the variation in the floors.","time":1584813517,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Renee North","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101321849184387393762/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUDPJPTpWFNsb2dRa63RM2O6JP-vlqlZXwBpK2xLUIGbRQOxxoD=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Terrible experience.
