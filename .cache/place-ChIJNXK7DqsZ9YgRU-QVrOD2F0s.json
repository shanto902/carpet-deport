I have worked with them on multiple projects and they are always one of the most affordable in terms of price. They do decent work.\n\nThe last project they did for me was luxury laminate flooring on the entire 2nd floor, as well as about 15 stairs + a foyer, which totalled about $10,000.  During this project, they cut the wood INSIDE of the house, leaving a thick film of sawdust on every inch of the entire upstairs level, which has now spread throughout the entire house by way of the HVAC system. Saw dust particles can be seen floating in the air throughout the entire house, on both floors. We have tried to clean it all, but it's impossible and requires very specific HEPA filters and tools to handle the fine dust, which is a carcinogen.\n\nThey offered a $150 credit to help pay for the costs to have this resolved, which was appreciated. However, the cost to fix the issue is upwards of $2,000. Me and my wife have started experiencing respiratory issues and issues breathing in the house. Both of us feel this \"film\"- like presence on top of our throat, making us cough. Again, I like the carpet Depot folks a lot, but there's no way cutting wood in the house is acceptable. I personally believe this practice should be banned. It was difficult to capture the saw dust in pictures, but I have attached several where you can see the thin film that now covers every inch of the top floor and still continues to float to the lower level of the house. Very disappointed in this experience.","time":1761009240,"translated":false},{"author_name":"cody heywood","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112313237126062589365/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ7diRFDB5Vt_iNANoHA55zQLGrt2mqUlr9yRWPQG6TJbHI9g=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Was happy to support a family owned business. In store they were helpful, patient and kind in helping me select a style. Fare pricing. And the gentlemen who came to install were quick, professional, and did an excellent job installing the carpet on my stairs. Highly recommend.","time":1761228789,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Heidi","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100681010007253763643/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXpfTBf6REEDuT2iVDIebxgZj0OQVcsygaVf8KyNioR482ukePL=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"10 months ago","text":"We’ve used them twice now and I’m pretty sure they’re now gonna be our go to floor guys for forever now 😂. Great quality carpet and LVP at great prices. They do free estimates for at least close by locations, they’re easy to schedule with, they beat the prices of everyone else for product + installation and they installed with expert precision and attention to detail. Left the place clean, and they were respectful of our space and time.","time":1741352241,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Evelyn Dinkins","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115228027958643670152/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXULsertcrVJUuwmO85VdwozFB5tJr5x6BDcwRnCKErpVGyQAU1=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"These guys spent a ridiculous amount of time with me, helping to pick out just the right carpet.

I'd been googling vinyl flooring to the point where I wanted to just set it all on fire and give up. Billy and John rescued me! Carpet Depot is an unassuming spot in a strip mall, small, like others have said, but floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall, flooring and carpet (from sample books to huge remnant rolls). It's got the friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable service box stores lack. The guy at the register (Billy) was intent in conversation with another customer but still took a sec to welcome me and let me know he'd be with me as soon as he could. Another employee (John) walked right up when he saw me wandering around to ask how he could help. Billy talked to me about what I needed it for (a van!), what my options were, and took me straight to what would be best for my project and budget. I don't see how one could claim it's lacking in options! Saw some gorgeous carpet colors out of the corner of my eye - plaid, even! They had a couple of vinyl plank color/patterns I wanted and had not been able to find *any* where else. I'm thrilled I didn't have to settle for something I didn't love. Billy even sat right down on the floor with me, to show me how to install it. I can see how communication might be a bit frustrating, since it's a mom and pop operation and there might sometimes be just one employee, but that was not my experience at ALL. And, it would be worth it for the quality, selection, and knowing I'm supporting a local business. Thank you!","time":1564003704,"translated":false}],"opening_hours":{"periods":[{"close":{"day":1,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":1,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":2,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":2,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":3,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":3,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":4,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":4,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":5,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":5,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":6,"time":"1500"},"open":{"day":6,"time":"0930"}}],"weekday_text":["Monday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM","Tuesday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM","Wednesday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM","Thursday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM","Friday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM","Saturday: 9:30 AM – 3:00 PM","Sunday: Closed"]}},"timestamp":1768649868555}
