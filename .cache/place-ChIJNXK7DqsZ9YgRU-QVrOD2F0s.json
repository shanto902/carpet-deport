Great quality carpet and LVP at great prices. They do free estimates for at least close by locations, theyâ€™re easy to schedule with, they beat the prices of everyone else for product + installation and they installed with expert precision and attention to detail. Left the place clean, and they were respectful of our space and time.","time":1741352241,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Evelyn Dinkins","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115228027958643670152/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXULsertcrVJUuwmO85VdwozFB5tJr5x6BDcwRnCKErpVGyQAU1=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"These guys spent a ridiculous amount of time with me, helping to pick out just the right carpet.

They completely understood what I wanted and offered me options that were within the price range I wanted. Never was I pressured to spend more. The carpet was installed quickly and professionally by the crew. I'm very happy with the entire experience, and would absolutely recommended the Carpet Depot in Mableton for anyone needing carpet.","time":1730055248,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Michele Hardeman","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112059276415798578857/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVdGf3DKuWJuAGz8yVEIutirP1Sdo2E2h_SX3JlxyOIjLqncU05=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"6 years ago","text":"A contractor friend of mine recommended Carpet Depot. I'd been googling vinyl flooring to the point where I wanted to just set it all on fire and give up. Billy and John rescued me! Carpet Depot is an unassuming spot in a strip mall, small, like others have said, but floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall, flooring and carpet (from sample books to huge remnant rolls). It's got the friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable service box stores lack. The guy at the register (Billy) was intent in conversation with another customer but still took a sec to welcome me and let me know he'd be with me as soon as he could. Another employee (John) walked right up when he saw me wandering around to ask how he could help. Billy talked to me about what I needed it for (a van!), what my options were, and took me straight to what would be best for my project and budget. I don't see how one could claim it's lacking in options! Saw some gorgeous carpet colors out of the corner of my eye - plaid, even! They had a couple of vinyl plank color/patterns I wanted and had not been able to find *any* where else. I'm thrilled I didn't have to settle for something I didn't love. Billy even sat right down on the floor with me, to show me how to install it. I can see how communication might be a bit frustrating, since it's a mom and pop operation and there might sometimes be just one employee, but that was not my experience at ALL. And, it would be worth it for the quality, selection, and knowing I'm supporting a local business. Thank you!","time":1564003704,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Rebecca Alvis","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108439109523529760457/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKc5R5v-DgoJyq9ojD6apk6P0NF0fKn1rKyu7xBFRZXNnmczg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"This is the second time we have purchased from Carpet Depot in Mableton. We easily found what we wanted. Ron handled our questions and got everything we needed.  Installation was quickly scheduled and quickly accomplished. Tico and Marcos were outstanding installers and we couldn't be happier.  I would not hesitate to recommend them.","time":1719588503,"translated":false}],"opening_hours":{"periods":[{"close":{"day":1,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":1,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":2,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":2,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":3,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":3,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":4,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":4,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":5,"time":"1700"},"open":{"day":5,"time":"0930"}},{"close":{"day":6,"time":"1500"},"open":{"day":6,"time":"0930"}}],"weekday_text":["Monday: 9:30â€¯AMâ€‰â€“â€‰5:00â€¯PM","Tuesday: 9:30â€¯AMâ€‰â€“â€‰5:00â€¯PM","Wednesday: 9:30â€¯AMâ€‰â€“â€‰5:00â€¯PM","Thursday: 9:30â€¯AMâ€‰â€“â€‰5:00â€¯PM","Friday: 9:30â€¯AMâ€‰â€“â€‰5:00â€¯PM","Saturday: 9:30â€¯AMâ€‰â€“â€‰3:00â€¯PM","Sunday: Closed"]}},"timestamp":1756735728086}
