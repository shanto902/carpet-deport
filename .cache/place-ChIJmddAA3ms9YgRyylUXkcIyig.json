Moved all of my furniture out of both rooms ahead of the day of installation only for Lowe’s to not have the product in stock and make no effort to fix the situation. I was looking at potentially weeks before a resolution.\n\nEnter Carpet Depot. I spoke with Suzette, who was wonderful. In a span of 5 hours, Suzette was able to find product matching my specifications AND was able to schedule same day installation. You just don’t get that kind of customer service or turnaround time from the big box stores. Would highly recommend, especially if you’re working with Suzette.","time":1753669345,"translated":false},{"author_name":"legrant culver","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118380314484977035621/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW3OX_gn-25WHI2gYH5B17oli5LyO-K9VPzmCF8H2mdayxM54b4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"I purchased carpet from Carpet Depot’s Decatur location for my man-cave project.

She was so happy to help and actually gave wonderful suggestions. Honestly I was scared because we initially were looking for an area rug and I happened to figure out that their catalog consists of actual carpet material. I was scared thinking the material would be off putting in our living room area but it actually looks so homey and comfortable. The price was beyond affordable compared to ordering an actual area rug or even going to buy one. I enjoyed this experience so much and certainly will be back should I need any further assistance!

It's rare these days not to walk away from big transactions where you don't feel like you have overpaid or been screwed over somehow. My experience with this business has offered nothing but reason after reason to give my future business to them.
