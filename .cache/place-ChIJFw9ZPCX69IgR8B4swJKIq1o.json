The salesman lied by omission and was deceptive.  I scheduled an appointment for the salesman to come out and take measurements. The salesman, Scott when taking the measurements had to of observed the doors and the space between the doors and the concrete flooring.   Scott, the salesman did not tell me before taking my full payment for installation that doors would need to be trimmed to close properly. The salesman also did not tell me that doors would be removed and left off after work was completed.  When, I followed up with Scott, he was initially evasive before eventually making me listen to his long condescending rant explaining how the doors have to be trimmed. Carpet Depot completely glossed over the fact that someone (either installers or retailer that hired installers) should have told me ahead of time that the doors needed to be trimmed. I like most customers don't get carpet installed everyday. Had I known, I would have chosen to have the doors trimmed prior to getting the carpet installed or chosen a company that could do it all at the same.","time":1761755556,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Joi “Joy2Bwith” Malone","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103641005896500500731/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUzklSJ-kuGBFKM99Q5XTeIawKoe14BBdSWSaDH2uzWyRSiBIHsrQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 years ago","text":"Shout out to Scott Thomas.......you make customer service look easy. From the first phone call to the follow up call.....every step has been seamless, professional, guided, timely, cost efficient and more than what I expected. I am speechless and impressed by the carpet selection and the install. The install team was the bomb.com in and out with precision......they cleaned up so well the new carpet was the only indicator of them being there.
