From the first phone call to the follow up call.....every step has been seamless, professional, guided, timely, cost efficient and more than what I expected. I am speechless and impressed by the carpet selection and the install. The install team was the bomb.com in and out with precision......they cleaned up so well the new carpet was the only indicator of them being there. Keep up the great work and look for some referrals to come your way. A referral gift card bonus would be nice......Thanks a million!","time":1590172914,"translated":false},{"author_name":"DOHC 106","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107820558939081905764/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXtq04gC7MvL2upengTsAh3TO0Zex2dvairpLE2IOao5eU0kawE=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"3 years ago","text":"My wife actually discovered the store while driving through Jonesboro.
